What have I learned so far?

This code does work... I am pretty sure.

How do I know? Overfit to a single or subset of images, and I can see the improvement.

Unfortunately model does have some capacity limitations.

Some next steps:

-   Add in and compare the SFT approach.
-   Run training in full, see if it works.
-   Try to add region encoder and decoder to a bigger model, tie on top of HF?
